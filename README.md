## Credit Management App
This React app is a part of The Spark Foundation Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP).

The requirements were as follows:
◇ Create a simple dynamic website which has the following specs.
◇ Start with creating dummy data in database for upto 10 users.
Database options: Mysql, Mongo, Postgres, etc. User table will
have basic fields such as name, email, current credit etc. Transfers
table will record all transfers happened.

Transfer Credit > Select user to transfer to > View all Users. Credit
is sort of points which can be transferred from one user to another
user.
◇ No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of credit between
multiple users.

other free hosting provider. Check in code in gitlab.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
